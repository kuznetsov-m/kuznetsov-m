### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am Python and C++ developer.

Just want to test the view counter. ğŸ™‚

<div align="center" style="margin: 40px 0">
   <a href="https://github.com/kuznetsov-m/github-profile-views-counter">
       <img width="110px" src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=kuznetsov-m&color=0f1217">
   </a>
</div>
